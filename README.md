# Banker's Algorithm

Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems. This repository provides an implementation of the Banker's Algorithm in Python, along with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library.

## Features

- Enter total resources, available resources, current allocation, and maximum need.

![Inputing The Data](https://github.com/NADAMAZENN/Bankers_Algorithm/blob/main/Images/Inputing%20Data.png)

- View tables for total resources, available resources, current allocation, maximum need, and resource need.

- Request resources for a specific process and check if the request can be granted.

- Visualize the algorithm's execution.

## Installation

To run the Banker's Algorithm program, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
      $ git clone https://github.com/NADAMAZENN/Bankers_Algorithm.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
      $ cd Bankers_Algorithm
3. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install them:
      $ pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To run the program, execute the `main.py` file:
    $ python main.py
    
This will launch the Banker's Algorithm GUI. Enter the required input data and click "Next" to proceed. Follow the instructions provided by the GUI to request resources and see the algorithm's execution.
