# Banker's Algorithm

Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems. This repository provides an implementation of the Banker's Algorithm in Python, along with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library.

## Features

- Enter total resources, available resources, current allocation, and maximum need.

![Inputing The Data](https://github.com/NADAMAZENN/Bankers_Algorithm/blob/main/Images/Inputing%20Data.png)

- View tables for total resources, available resources, current allocation, maximum need, and resource need.

- Request resources for a specific process and check if the request can be granted.

- Visualize the algorithm's execution.
